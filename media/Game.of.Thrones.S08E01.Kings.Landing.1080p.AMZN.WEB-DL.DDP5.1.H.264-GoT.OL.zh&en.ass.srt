107
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,190
亡者大军正向南行进
the dead march south.

108
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,400
一听到长城倒塌的消息
As soon as we heard about the Wall,

109
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,610
我就召集了所有的封臣 撤退到临冬城
I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell.

110
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
安柏大人……
Lord Umber...

111
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,150
你的人什么时候到？
when can we expect your people to arrive?

112
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,310
我们需要更多的马匹和马车 希望夫人允许
We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.

113
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,270
以及大人……
And my lord.

114
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,110
和女王陛下允许 抱歉
And my queen. Sorry.

115
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,150
我们将为你倾囊相助
You'll have as many as we can spare.

116
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,440
尽快回到最后壁炉城 带你的人过来
Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.

117
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,150
我们还需要放出渡鸦 把消息传给守夜人
We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well.

118
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,690
现在还在这些城堡驻扎已经毫无意义了
There's no sense in manning the castles anymore.

119
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,860
我们要守住这里
We make our stand here.

120
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,020
马上去办 陛下
At once, Your Grace.

121
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,560
“陛下”
"Your Grace."

122
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,060
现在您已经不是陛下了 对吧？
But you're not. Are you?

123
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,520
您离开临冬城的时候还是北境之王
You left Winterfell a king

124
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,020
可回来时候却是一位——
and came back a--

125
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,480
我不太清楚您现在的身份到底算什么
I'm not sure what you are now.

126
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,110
公爵大人？
A lord?

127
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,480
或者您现在什么都不是？
Nothing at all?

128
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,770
- 这不重要 - 不重要？
-It's not important. -Not important?

129
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,150
曾经 我们可是拥立您为北境之王
We named you King in the North.

130
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,230
北境之王呐！
King of the North!

131
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,110
确实 夫人
You did, my lady.

132
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,480
那曾经是我人生中的荣光
It was the honor of my life.

133
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,270
我将永远对你们的信任感念于心
I'll always be grateful for your faith.

134
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,650
但当初我离开临冬城的时候
But when I left Winterfell,

135
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,400
我告诉过大家我们需要盟友 否则我们只有死路一条
I told you we need allies or we will die.

136
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,270
而现在我把盟友带回了家
I have brought those allies home

137
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
与我们并肩作战
to fight alongside us.

138
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,400
我必须做出选择
I had a choice,

139
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,520
是保住我的王位还是保住北境
keep my crown or protect the North.

140
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,480
我选择了北境
I chose the North.

141
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,190
我们当中 要是有人能在接下来这场大战中活下来
If anyone survives the war to come,

142
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,940
那就得感谢琼恩·雪诺
we'll have Jon Snow to thank.

143
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,860
他冒着生命危险 证明威胁我们的东西是真实存在的
He risked his life to show us the threat is real.

144
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,730
多亏了他的勇气
Thanks to his courage,

145
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,860
我们才能带来
we have brought with us the greatest army

146
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,020
有史以来最强大的军队
the world has ever seen.

147
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,310
我们才能带回两条成年巨龙
We have brought two full-grown dragons.

148
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,860
很快 兰尼斯特家族的军队
And soon, the Lannister army

149
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,020
就会行军北上加入我们
will ride north to join our cause.

150
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,150
我知道 我知道 我们家族
I know, I know, our people

151
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,810
一直也算不上北境的盟友
haven't been friends in the past.

152
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,860
但我们现在必须携手作战……
But we must fight together now...

153
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
否则我们都会死
or die.

154
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,480
我想问一下 我们该怎么供给
May I ask,how are we meant to feed

155
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,520
这支有史以来最强大的军队呢？
the greatest army the world has ever seen?

156
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,230
我能确保我们的存粮能撑过这个冬天
While I ensured our stores would last through winter,

157
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,060
但我可没有料到还要给多斯拉克大军
I didn't account for Dothraki,

158
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,860
无垢者 甚至两条成年巨龙做准备
Unsullied and two full-grown dragons.

159
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
对了 龙吃什么？
What do dragons eat, anyway?

160
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,980
想吃什么就吃什么
Whatever they want.

161
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,270
嘿 注意点 小子 一丁点儿也不能漏掉
Hey, careful, lads.We need every last bit of it.

162
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,650
抱歉
Sorry 'bout that.

163
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,480
这是最后一车了吗？
Are these the last of the wagons?

164
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,980
是的
Aye.

165
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,690
好吧 全都推去锻造处
All right, let's get it all to the forges.

166
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,690
大人
My lord.

167
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,860
夫人
My lady.

168
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
我先退下了
My lady.

169
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,940
临冬城公爵夫人
The Lady of Winterfell.

170
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,730
这头衔不错啊
Has a nice ring to it.

171
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,690
女王之手也不错
So does Hand of the Queen.

172
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,020
这得看是哪位女王了
Depending on the queen, I suppose.

173
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,440
我们上次谈话 还是在乔佛里的婚礼上
Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding.

174
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,520
- 真是不幸 - 总归有它的意义
- Miserable affair.- It had its moments.

175
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,520
我很抱歉就那样离开了
Apologies for leaving like that.

176
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,150
的确 有点难以解释
Yes,it was a bit hard to explain

177
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,980
为什么在国王被谋杀后 我的妻子就逃跑了
why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.

178
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,770
但我们现在都还活着
We both survived.

179
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,440
许多人低估了你
Many underestimated you.

180
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,270
他们当中 大部分都已经死了
Most of them are dead now.

181
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,940
听到兰尼斯特大军北上的消息
I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear

182
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,900
你应该并不高兴吧
the Lannister army's marching north.

183
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,190
你对我姐姐的恐惧可以理解
You have every right to be fearful of my sister.

184
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,730
没人比我更怕她
No one fears her more than I do.

185
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,730
- 但我一定会确保你的安全—— - 瑟曦跟你说
- But I promise, you'll be safe---Cersei told you her army

186
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,560
她的军队会来北境为你作战？
was coming north to fight for you?

187
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,650
是的
She did.

188
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,690
你也信了？
And you believed her?

189
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,810
她现在有了活下去的动力
She has something to live for now.

190
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,690
我相信她是想活着的
I believe she wants to survive.

191
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,650
我还以为你是世界上最聪明的人
I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.

192
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,310
你以前看起来更高一些
You used to be taller.

193
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,650
你怎么跟到我的？
How did you sneak up on me?

194
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,560
你不是被一剑穿心了吗 你是怎么活下来的？
How did you survive a knife through the heart?

195
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,150
其实我当时已经死了
I didn't.

196
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,730
你还留着它
You still have it.

197
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,150
缝衣针
Needle.

198
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,060
你用过它吗？
Have you ever used it?

199
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,730
一两次吧
Once or twice.

200
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,900
瓦雷利亚钢剑
Valyrian steel.

201
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,440
羡慕吗？
Jealous?

202
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,690
对我来说太沉了
Too heavy for me.

203
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,730
你之前去哪儿了？
Where were you before?

204
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,520
你可以帮我跟珊莎说说好话的
I could've used your help with Sansa.

205
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,770
她不喜欢你的女王 对吧？
She doesn't like your queen,does she?

206
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,610
珊莎觉得她比谁都聪明
Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.

207
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,980
她是我遇到过的最聪明的人
She's the smartest person I've ever met.

208
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,650
你是在保护她吗？
Now you're defending her?

209
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,110
是吗？
You?

210
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,230
我保护的是我们的家族
I'm defending our family.

211
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,770
她也一样
So is she.

212
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,270
是啊
Yeah.

213
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,310
我也是她的家人
I'm her family too.

214
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,610
别忘了这一点
Don't forget that.

215
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,810
陛下 恐怕我带来了个坏消息
Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news.

216
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
亡者大军已经攻破长城了
The dead have broken through the Wall.

217
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,860
好
Good.

218
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,440
不如你就干脆一点杀了我吧
Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?

219
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,480
我们可是一家人
But we're family.

220
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,440
葛雷乔伊家族仅剩的几个
The last Greyjoys left in the world.

221
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,610
反正也是最有种的
The last ones with balls anyway.

222
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,900
如果我杀了你……
If I kill you...

223
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,860
我跟谁说话去？
who can I talk to?

224
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,150
嗯？
Hmm?

225
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,020
我的船员都是哑巴
I've got a crew full of mutes.

226
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,060
在海上 人就容易寂寞
It gets lonely at sea.

227
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,730
我们在君临城吗？
Are we in King's Landing?

228
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,900
嗯
Mm.

229
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,560
你选错边了
You picked the losing side.

230
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,900
那我就带着铁舰队去别处呗
Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.

231
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,900
但首先我得和女王干上一炮
But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

232
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,190
两万大军 是吗？
Twenty-thousand men, is it?

233
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,310
是的 陛下 少数人死在来的路上了
Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.

234
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,110
是因为他们玩骰子出老千
They cheated at dice.

235
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,020
也许是我出老千
Or maybe I cheated.

236
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,230
反正有人出了
Someone cheated.

237
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,860
他们打仗不怎么厉害 没了也不是什么损失
They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.

238
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,860
- 马有多少？ - 两千
Horses? Two thousand.

239
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,190
大象呢
And elephants?

240
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,650
呃 禀告陛下 我们没有大象
Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.

241
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,440
真让我失望
That's disappointing.

242
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,980
我听说黄金团是有大象的
I was told the Golden Company had elephants.

243
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,440
大象确实是非凡的猛兽 陛下
They are excellent beasts, Your Grace

244
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,020
但不适应海上长途航行
but not well-suited to long sea voyages.

245
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,650
不管怎样 君临都欢迎你们的到来
In any event, you are most welcome

246
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,900
斯崔克兰团长
here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.

247
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,190
我们期待为您作战 陛下
We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.

248
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,810
那这里欢迎我吗
Am I most welcome here?

249
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,940
你是王室真诚的朋友
You are a true friend of the crown

250
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,900
也是备受尊敬的贵宾
and an honored guest.

251
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,230
好
Good.

252
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,360
那作为真诚的朋友和尊敬的贵宾……
As a true friend and an honored guest...

253
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,360
我希望我们可以私下谈谈
I was hoping we could talk in private.

254
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,770
战争结束再提此事 我们已经达成协议了
After the war. That was our agreement.

255
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,690
战争也许会持续数年
Wars sometimes last years.

256
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,360
你想要妓女 就去花金子买
You want a whore, buy one.

257
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,520
你如果想要女王……
You want a queen...

258
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,520
就得赢得她
earn her.

259
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,360
我该怎么做？
How?

260
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,810
我已经帮她主持正义
I've given her justice,

261
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,610
给了她佣兵团和一支铁舰队
an army and the Iron Fleet,

262
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,730
然而她却没有表露出一丝爱意
yet she gives me no sign of affection.

263
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,860
我的心都要碎了
My heart is nearly broken.

264
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,400
你太放肆了
You're insolent.

265
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,520
- 因为无礼而被我处死的人 他们还没有你嚣张 - 他们在其他方面也不如我
-I've executed men for less. -They were lesser men.

266
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,230
听说 龙烧死了一千兰尼斯特士兵
I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.

267
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,230
死了几个我最喜欢的小伙子
Burnt up some of my favorite boys.

268
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,980
- 是阿奇吗？ - 还有威廉
-Archie, was it? -And William.

269
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,060
- 那个又高又帅的威廉？- 对 就是他
-Tall handsome William? -Yeah, tall handsome William.

270
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,810
听说他被烧剩的骨头渣 只够盛满一个酒杯
They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.

271
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,360
我是你们见过的 唯一一个射过龙的人
I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.

272
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,190
- 真的？- 差点把它杀死了
-Did you? -Nearly killed it.

273
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,230
那你真英勇
That's brave.

274
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,110
- 那个叫艾迪的小子……   - 那个红头发的？
-That boy Eddie...  -The ginger?

275
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,360
就是他 回来时脸都烧没了
That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off.

276
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,690
他现在没有眼皮了
He's got no eyelids now.

277
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,400
没眼皮他怎么睡觉啊？
How does he sleep with no eyelids?

278
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,980
好了 能不能别他妈聊龙的事了？
All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?

279
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,940
黑水河的波隆骑士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

280
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,230
你逗我呢吧
You're kidding me.

281
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,730
抱歉打扰了
Apologies for the interruption,

282
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,150
但女王确实催促我尽快前来
but the queen did urge me to hurry.

283
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,770
抱歉 姑娘们
Sorry, ladies.

284
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,360
下次吧
Another time perhaps.

285
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,810
你有过空虚寂寞的时候吗 我挺喜欢年纪大的男人
You ever get lonely, I am partial to older gentlemen.

286
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,110
可怜的姑娘 看这梅毒病情 她活不过一年了
Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.

287
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,730
- 你说哪个姑娘？ - 女王的弟弟们曾对你许诺
-Which girl? -The queen's brothers

288
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,440
但他们没能坚守诺言
made promises to you and broke them.

289
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,810
女王陛下想要弥补这个过失
Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.

290
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,940
她曾给了我城堡和妻子
She once gave me a castle and a wife,

291
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,690
然后又全部从我手中夺走
then rectified me right out of them.

292
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,060
那是詹姆爵士所为 与她无关
That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.

293
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,020
如果瑟曦女王对你有所求
When Queen Cersei wants something,

294
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,900
她会预付你黄金
she pays in advance and in gold.

295
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,730
实际上 是成箱的黄金
Several chests of it, in fact.

296
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,020
它们正在门外的马车里等着你
Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.

297
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:31,440
所以她想杀人 又不能派自己的士兵去
So she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers.

298
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,610
如果她盯上的的是龙女王……
If it's the Dragon Queen she's after...

299
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,770
对于那个坦格利安女孩 她另有谋划
She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.

300
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,940
啊 好吧 那祝计划成功
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

301
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,860
女王的弟弟们可能不会
Our queen's brothers are unlikely

302
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,270
在北境历险后平安归来
to survive their Northern adventures.

303
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,690
但 万一他们活下来了……
But in the event that they do...

304
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,900
她想品味一场诗意的复仇
She has a keen sense of poetic justice.

305
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,980
这一家人都有病
That fucking family.

306
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,810
学城驱逐我的时候
When the Citadel expelled me,

307
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,730
我以为我会潦倒孤独而死
I thought I would die poor and alone,

308
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,810
但为了回报我的衷心侍奉  瑟曦女王封我为女王之手
but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand.

309
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,770
如果有人能帮她除掉叛国的弟弟们
What would she do for the man

310
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,230
她又会如何回报呢？
who rids her of her treasonous brothers?

311
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,730
我本来想要大象的
I wanted those elephants.

312
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,770
那……
So...

313
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,610
我和那个胖国王比起来怎么样？
how do I compare to the fat king?

314
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,440
你在侮辱我的先夫吗？
You're insulting my late husband?

315
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,770
那你被冒犯了吗？
Are you offended?

316
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,020
劳勃每晚都和不同的妓女过夜
Robert had a different whore every night

317
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,110
但还是不懂该怎样对待女人的身体
but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.

318
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,150
跟弑君者比呢？
And the Kingslayer?

319
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,770
你真是喜欢作死啊
You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?

320
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,610
活着没意思
Life is boring.

321
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,810
但你不是个无趣的人 这一点我承认
You're not boring, I'll give you that.

322
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,770
我是否取悦了女王陛下？
Do I please the queen?

323
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,610
你可能是我遇见的最傲慢无礼的人
You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met.

324
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,150
我喜欢
I like that.

325
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,480
但现在我想独自待着
But now I want to be alone.

326
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,770
我要让你怀上我的王子
I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

327
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,690
攸伦保不住铁群岛
Euron can't defend the Iron Islands,

328
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,270
既然他和全部人马 舰队都在君临
not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.

329
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,020
我们可以趁机夺回铁群岛
We can take our home back.

330
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,610
丹妮莉丝去了北境
Daenerys went north.

331
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,610
如果北境失守
Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat

332
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,230
那丹妮莉丝就需要后撤的基地
if they can't hold the North.

333
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,060
而尸鬼到不了铁群岛
Somewhere the dead can't go.

334
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,610
我奉你为女王 听你号令 追随于你
You're my queen. I go where you command.

335
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
你想去临冬城
You want to go to Winterfell.

336
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,110
为史塔克家战斗
To fight for the Starks.

337
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
去吧
Go.

338
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,860
逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

339
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,310
逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

340
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,270
不管怎样 干掉那些杂种
But kill the bastards anyway.

341
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,730
欢迎回家 小姐
Welcome back, my lady.

342
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,440
请跟我来……
If you'd follow me...

343
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,730
卡史塔克家来了
The Karstarks.

344
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,980
家族纹章不错
One of the better sigils.

345
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,520
反正比洋葱好看
Beats an onion, anyway.

346
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,610
无可辩驳
Can't argue with that.

347
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,810
史塔克和卡史塔克在战场上互相残杀
Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks

348
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,270
才过去没多久
were slaughtering each other on the battlefield.

349
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
是琼恩·雪诺让两家重归于好
Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

350
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,400
女王陛下对此感激不尽
And our queen is grateful.

351
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,730
这自然很好 但重点不是这个
Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point.

352
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,860
北境效忠于琼恩·雪诺 不是丹妮莉丝
The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her.

353
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,020
他们根本不认识她
They don't know her.

354
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,440
自由民也不认她
The Free Folk don't know her.

355
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,360
我在北境呆的时间不短 你得知道
I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you,

356
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,270
这儿的人倔得像头牛
they're stubborn as goats.

357
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,980
你得自己去争得他们的忠心
You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.

358
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,900
我觉得你心里有话想说
I sense that you're leading to a proposal.

359
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,690
我想说的就是我正在说的
A proposal is what I'm proposing.

360
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:49,150
如果我们侥幸打败夜王活下来之后
On the off chance that we survive the Night King,

361
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,770
如果七大王国能迎来
what if the Seven Kingdoms,

362
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,270
史上他妈的第一次
for once in their whole shit history,

363
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,900
由一位公正的女性和一位正直的男性共同统治 会怎样呢？
were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?

364
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,190
他俩确实是天生一对
They do make a handsome couple.

365
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,020
你高估我们的影响力了
You overestimate our influence.

366
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,480
他们才不会听这些单身老男人的话
Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.

367
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,270
我可不是老男人
I'm not that old.

368
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,980
没他那么老
Not as old as him.

369
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,150
我们的女王很尊敬长者的智慧
Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

370
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,610
当然
Of course she does.

371
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,440
这就叫敬而远之
Respect is how the young keep us at a distance,

372
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,020
好让我们不去忠言逆耳
so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.

373
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,310
什么忠言
What is that?

374
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,810
没有什么是永恒的
Nothing lasts.

375
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,440
嘿！
Hey!

376
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,270
你妹妹不喜欢我
Your sister doesn't like me.

377
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,060
因为她不了解你
She doesn't know you.

378
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,440
那我这样说你可能好受一些
If it makes you feel any better,

379
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,270
小时候她也不喜欢我
she didn't like me either when we were growing up.

380
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,480
我并不是要她把我当作朋友
She doesn't need to be my friend...

381
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,980
但我是她的女王
but I am her queen.

382
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,440
如果她不尊敬我……
If she can't respect me...

383
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,500
今天它们吃了多少

384
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,300
只有十八只山羊 十一只绵羊

385
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,560
什么事
What's the matter?

386
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,150
龙的胃口不太好
The dragons are barely eating.

387
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,810
它们怎么了
What's wrong with them?

388
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,480
它们不喜欢北境
They don't like the North.

389
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,860
上来啊
Go on.

390
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,310
我不懂怎么驾驭巨龙
I don't know how to ride a dragon.

391
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,900
没人生来就会 骑上来就行了
Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.

392
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,900
要是它不想让我坐上去呢
What if he doesn't want me to?

393
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,900
那我就会感谢你一直以来的陪伴 琼恩·雪诺
Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.

394
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,020
我该抓住什么
What do I hold onto?

395
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,860
能抓什么抓什么吧
Whatever you can.

396
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,690
啊！
Aah!

397
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,650
你毁了我对骑马的兴趣
You've completely ruined horses for me.

398
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,860
我们可以在这儿呆一千年
We could stay a thousand years...

399
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,360
谁也找不到我们
no one would find us.

400
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,230
到那时候 我们就很老了
We'd be pretty old.

401
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,440
对南方姑娘来说 这里确实太冷了
It's cold up here for a southern girl.

402
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,230
那还不给你的女王一点温暖
So keep your queen warm.

403
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,060
别怕 没事儿
Don't be afraid.

404
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,770
这个不错
That's good.

405
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,480
- 詹德利？- 他在这儿
- Gendry? - He's here.

406
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,480
用龙晶锻造如此巨大的剑并不容易
It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.

407
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,940
你不是说自己很厉害吗 嗯？
You're saying you're good, is that it?

408
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,020
我只是说 这材料挺棘手的
I'm just saying it's a tricky material to--

409
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,150
你知道为野人打造武器的都是什么人吗？
You know who makes weapons for the wildlings?

410
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,610
不是瘸子就是混蛋
Cripples and cocksuckers.

411
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,270
- 你是哪一类 - 放过他吧
- Which one are you? - Leave him be.

412
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,060
我听说你来了
I heard you were here.

413
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,110
你把我扔下等死
You left me to die.

414
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,810
我还先抢劫了你呢
First I robbed you.

415
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,610
你可真是个冷血小贱人 不是吗？
You're a cold little bitch, aren't you?

416
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,360
我猜正因如此你才能活到今天
Guess that's why you're still alive.

417
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,650
你为他打的那把斧子真不错
That was a nice ax you made for him.

418
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,940
你比以前更厉害了
You've gotten better.

419
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,480
对 谢谢 你也一样
Yeah, thanks. So have you.

420
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,020
我的意思是你看起来不错
I mean, you look good.

421
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
谢了 你也是
Thanks. So do you.

422
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,020
要不是太冷 在这地方长大还挺不错的
It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.

423
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,060
那就靠炉子近一点儿
Stay close to that forge, then.

424
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,770
- 这是命令吗？史塔克小姐 - 别这么叫我
- Is that a command, Lady Stark? - Don't call me that.

425
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,020
遵命 小姐
As you wish, milady.

426
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,520
我想要这个
Here's my wish.

427
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,980
你能做出来吗？
Can you make it?

428
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,230
你用这东西做什么用？
What do you need something like this for?

429
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,560
你到底能不能做出来？
Can you make it or not?

430
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,520
你不是已经有一把剑了 这又是什么？
You already have a sword. What's that?

431
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,480
这是瓦雷利亚钢
It's Valyrian steel.

432
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,940
我就知道你也是个有钱姑娘
I always knew you were just another rich girl.

433
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,440
说得好像你还认识其他有钱姑娘一样
You don't know any other rich girls.

434
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,860
请进
Come in.

435
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,230
葛洛佛大人祝我们好运
Lord Glover wishes us good fortune,

436
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,650
但他会和手下人留在深林堡
but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.

437
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,480
“葛洛佛家族将继续效忠于史塔克家族
"House Glover will stand behind House Stark

438
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,940
一如千年以来那样”
as we have for a thousand years."

439
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,400
他之前不就是这么说的吗？
Isn't that what he said?

440
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,400
“我将效忠于琼恩·雪诺” 他是这么说的
"I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.

441
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,270
“北境之王”
"The King in the North."

442
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,150
我们需要盟友 我告诉过你
I told you we needed allies.

443
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,480
可你没说过会将王位拱手让人
You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.

444
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,690
我从未想过当什么国王
I never wanted a crown.

445
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,520
我只想要保护北境
All I wanted was to protect the North.

446
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,360
我带回家两支军队 两条龙
I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.

447
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,110
还有一位坦格利安家的女王
And a Targaryen queen.

448
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,560
你真觉得
Do you think

449
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,860
没有她 我们能打败尸鬼大军？
we can beat the Army of the Dead without her?

450
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,900
珊莎 我亲自与它们战斗过 两次
I fought them, Sansa. Twice.

451
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,190
如果你在意的是头衔称谓
You want to worry about who holds what title,

452
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,730
那我就告诉你 这无关紧要
I'm telling you it doesn't matter.

453
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,480
没有她 我们连一丝胜算都没有
Without her, we don't stand a chance.

454
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,980
你相信我吗？哪怕一点儿
Do you have any faith in me at all?

455
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,860
你懂我的 一如既往
You know I do.

456
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,940
她会是一位优秀的女王
She'll be a good queen.

457
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,110
对我们所有人而言
For all of us.

458
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,270
她不像她的父亲那样
She's not her father.

459
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,480
对 她可漂亮多了
No, she's much prettier.

460
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,440
你屈膝下跪 究竟是为了拯救北境
Did you bend the knee to save the North

461
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,020
还是因为你爱上了她？
or because you love her?

462
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,310
噢！
Oh!

463
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,980
就是你吗？
So you're the man?

464
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,520
呃
Um...

465
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,650
女王陛下 您说的是？
Which man am I, Your Grace?

466
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,980
无人能够挽救乔拉爵士的性命时 是你挺身而出
The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.

467
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,230
他们可以出手 只是不愿罢了
They could, they just wouldn't.

468
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,480
当我夺回王位时
I'll have to make some changes

469
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,310
会在学城做一些改变
in the Citadel when I take my throne.

470
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,980
你尽心竭力的服务配得上一流的回报
A great service merits a great reward.

471
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,730
噢 能够效忠您就是我的荣幸了 陛下
Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.

472
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,860
很好 不过我总能赏赐给你一些东西吧
Well, there must be something I could give you.

473
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,980
恕我冒昧
If it's not too much trouble,

474
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,480
我想请求您的宽恕
I could use a pardon.

475
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,810
你犯下了什么罪过呢？
For what crime?

476
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,060
呃
Um--

477
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,900
我从学城借走了一些书
I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.

478
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,310
还有一把剑
And also a sword.

479
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,860
- 剑也是学城的？- 不 剑属于我的家族
- From the Citadel? - From my family.

480
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,270
那把剑是塔利家族的 代代相传
It's been in House Tarly for generations.

481
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,440
最后本该传到我的手上
It would've been mine anyway, eventually,

482
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,480
但我的父亲另有打算
but my father had other ideas.

483
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,230
你父亲不会是蓝道·塔利吧？
Not Randyll Tarly?

484
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,610
您认识他？
You know him?

485
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,190
若他那时向我屈膝投降
I offered to let him retain his lands and titles

486
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,360
我会允许他保留封地和头衔
if he bent the knee.

487
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,560
可他拒绝了
He refused.

488
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,610
那
Well...

489
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,690
既然如此 我弟弟就是角陵伯爵了
At least I'll be allowed home again,

490
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,440
至少我还可以回家吧
now that my brother's the lord.

491
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,940
你弟弟与你父亲坚持同样的立场
Your brother stood with your father.

492
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,480
嗯
Hm.

493
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,900
陛下 谢谢您
Thank you, Your Grace.

494
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,400
把这一切告诉我
For telling me.

495
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,230
那我
And m--

496
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,860
- 我可否…… - 退下吧
- May I...? - Of course.

497
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,520
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing out here?

498
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,020
等一个老朋友
Waiting, for an old friend.

499
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,440
是时候告诉琼恩真相了
It's time to tell Jon the truth.

500
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
不 我不行
No, no.

501
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,440
你是他的弟弟 不该由你来告诉他吗
You're his brother.Shouldn't you tell him?

502
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,650
我不是他的弟弟
I'm not his brother.

503
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,020
他信任你胜过任何人
He trusts you more than anyone.

504
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,060
现在是时候了
Now's the time.

505
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,610
山姆？
Sam?

506
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,480
抱歉，我知道我不应该下到这来
I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.

507
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,110
- 你一直在躲着我吗？ - 当然不是
- Were you hiding from me? - Of course not.

508
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,360
你怎么会在临冬城？
What are you doing in Winterfell?

509
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,110
还是说你已经读完了学城所有的书？
Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?

510
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,310
怎么了？
What's wrong?

511
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,860
吉莉？她没事吧？
Gilly? Is she all right?

512
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,770
- 她没事 - 小山姆呢？
- She's good. - Little Sam?

513
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,900
你不知道吗？
Don't you know?

514
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,400
知道什么？
Know what?

515
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:40,810
丹妮莉丝……
Daenerys...

516
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,150
她处决了我父亲还有弟弟
she executed my father and brother.

517
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,810
她曾俘虏他们
They were her prisoners.

518
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,810
她没告诉你
She didn't tell you.

519
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,480
对此我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

520
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,690
我们需要结束这场战争
We need to end this war.

521
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,020
你也会那么做吗？
Would you have done it?

522
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,060
我也曾处决过不服从我的人
Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.

523
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,860
但你也宽恕过很多人
You've also spared men.

524
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,520
几千拒绝屈膝臣服的野人
Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.

525
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,060
那时我又不是国王
I wasn't a king.

526
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,480
不 你是
But you were.

527
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,520
你一直都是
You've always been.

528
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,190
我已经放弃王位了 山姆
I gave up my crown, Sam.

529
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,980
我已屈膝臣服
I bent the knee.

530
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,610
不再是北境之王了
I'm not King in the North anymore.

531
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,270
我说的不是北境之王
I'm not talking about the King in the North.

532
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,610
我说的是整个七大王国的国王
I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

533
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,900
布兰和我查清楚了
Bran and I worked it out.

534
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,810
我拿到一本总主教的日记 布兰有……
I had a High Septon's diary.Bran had...

535
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,270
先不提布兰有什么了
whatever Bran has.

536
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,310
你到底在说什么？
What are you talking about?

537
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,480
你的母亲
Your mother...

538
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,980
是莱安娜·史塔克
was Lyanna Stark.

539
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,900
而你的父亲……
And your father...

540
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,150
你的亲生父亲
your real father

541
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,900
是雷加·坦格利安
was Rhaegar Targaryen.

542
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,690
你从来都不是什么私生子
You've never been a bastard.

543
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,520
你真名为伊耿·坦格利安 铁王座的正统继承人
You're Aegon Targaryen,true heir to the Iron Throne.

544
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,560
抱歉 我知道这些很难接受
I'm sorry,I know it's a lot to take in.

545
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,110
我父亲是我见过的最信守荣誉之人
My father was the most honorable man I ever met.

546
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,730
你却告诉我他骗了我一辈子
You're saying he lied to me all my life.

547
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:45,940
不
No.

548
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,440
你父亲 好吧 奈德·史塔克
Your father-- Well, Ned Stark.

549
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,900
他向你母亲承诺会一直保护你
He promised your mother he'd always protect you.

550
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,770
而他确实做到了 劳勃如果知道了真相一定会杀了你
And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew.

551
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,270
你才是真正的国王
You're the true king.

552
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,310
伊耿·坦格利安六世
Aegon Targaryen,Sixth of His Name,

553
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
全境守护者 还有那一串头衔
Protector of the Realm,all of it.

554
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,900
- 丹妮莉丝是我们的女王 - 可她不该是
- Daenerys is our queen. - She shouldn't be.

555
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,810
- 你这是叛国 - 我这是说出真相
- That's treason. - It's the truth.

556
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,150
你能为保护子民而放弃王位
You gave up your crown to save your people.

557
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,480
她也能做到吗？
Would she do the same?

558
